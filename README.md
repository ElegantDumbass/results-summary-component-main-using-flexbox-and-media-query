## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

i guess its a mistake to try to challange myself using only flexbox and pure html+css.
there is a lot of ways i can make my stylesheet more efficient or better, or even more coherent to other people reading this(i pray that you understand my code lol)

1. i learned about the existance of transition
2. linear gradient
3. posistion(i still don't quite understand this)
4. filter:drop-shadow

### Continued development

i will come back to this challange for fixing my code and try to do it with better equipment(grid).
i still don't quite understand what to do with media query, i got better, but still quite bad(imo) i don't know how to use it effectively, if i get some advice or just a solution, i'll try to fix it.
or even in any part of my code if you have a better way to write my code or just make my code more beautiful and easier understand please give me an advice or solution, then i'll continue to developed it.

## Acknowledgments

this is not the best i could do(hopefully) i'll try to fix any mistakes and improve on i have written.
i do not use :

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

wich is a mistake, given i am just bangging my head towards a wall trying to make this code work.
i don't even know until after i finish there is a Mobile-first workflow(this could help me a lot)
if you see my stylesheet you'll find a lot of notes, most of them are for myslef, but if you have any advice or learning direction i should take please tell me, i would greatly appriciate it [:)]
or if you got a great solution please also tell me.
thank you very much.

sincierly a dumbass trying to be elegant.
